# Experimental features

<!-- 
Policies for maintaining this page:

Cover the latest Canary version and the latest Stable version.  Address both extremes (Stable v[n] and Canary v[n+3]) explicitly, in visible text - this is required, for maintainability of this maximally volatile info.

Keep h2 sections in same order as Microsoft Edge DevTools > Experiments page.
In the heading and UI steps, keep the checkbox label UI string as-is (don't revise or "fix" it).
Include a visible h2 section for every checkbox that's in public-facing Microsoft Edge DevTools > Experiments page.  If no info, write a tautology as a starting point.
When a checkbox is removed from all the preview channels, move its section down to "Previously Experimental features which are now regular features" and comment it out.  Same w/ any "on by default" list item.

Do the following, monthly:

1. Open Edge Stable > Settings > Experiments, go to edge://settings/help, update if needed, make sure the article has an h2 for each checkbox.
2. In each h2 section, write visibly & explicitly:
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Stable v123.
1. Update the Edge Stable list at top, re: On By Default checkboxes. Link down to the h2, do not link to other page, here.

4. Open Edge Canary > Settings > Experiments, go to edge://settings/help, update if needed, make sure the article has an h2 for each checkbox.
5. In each h2 section, write visibly & explicitly:
This checkbox is|is not present in Microsoft Edge Canary v123.
1. Update the Edge Canary list at top, re: On By Default checkboxes. Link down to the h2, do not link to other page, here.
-->

Microsoft Edge DevTools provide access to experimental features that are still in development.  This article lists and describes the experimental features which are in either:
*  The latest version of the Canary preview channel of Microsoft Edge.
*  The latest version of the Stable version of Microsoft Edge.

All [channels of Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels) have experimental features. You can get the latest experimental features by using the [Microsoft Edge Canary channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/welcome?channel=canary). To view the full list available in your version of Microsoft Edge, see the **Settings** > **Experiments** page in DevTools.

<!-- no Warning formatting, because UI already contains red "WARNING" at top -->
These experiments could be unstable or unreliable and may require you to restart DevTools.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Focus Mode

The Focus Mode experiment provides an **Activity Bar**, which is a compact horizontal or vertical toolbar that works well in a smaller window.  The activity bar contains small icons instead of tabs with text labels, and it replaces the main toolbar.

*  The **Activity Bar** is a compact replacement for the main toolbar.
*  The **Quick View** list is a replacement for the tabs on the Drawer toolbar.

![Focus Mode, including the Activity Bar.](../media/experimental-features/focus-mode.png)

To add a tool to the activity bar, open the tool.

To remove a tool from the Activity Bar:

*  Right-click its icon and then select **Remove from activity bar**.

The following tools are always present on the **Activity Bar**, and cannot be removed:

*  The **Inspect** tool and Device Emulation.
*  The **Elements**, **Console**, and **Sources** tools.

To switch to Focus Mode to show the Activity Bar instead of the main toolbar:

1. In DevTools, select **Settings** (![Settings icon.](../media/settings-gear-icon-light-theme.png)) > **Experiments**.

1. Select the **Focus Mode** checkbox.

1. Click the **Close** (**X**) button in the upper right, and then click the **Reload DevTools** button.

   The Activity Bar appears on the left.  The main toolbar goes away.

   The Drawer toolbar is replaced by a **Quick View** list of the tools, instead of tabs.  All of the tab tools are available in the **Quick View** list (including **Elements**, **Console**, and **Sources**).  Drag the Drawer up to expand it.

See also:

* [About the list of tools](../about-tools.md).

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Detached Elements
<!-- PM: "The Detached Elements checkbox is visible to all Edge users since Edge 93.
The experiment was turned on by default in Edge 93 for all internal (so has a microsoft.com account in Edge) DevTools customers.
Starting with Edge 97, the experiment will be turned on by default for all Edge users" -->

Memory leaks in web applications can be difficult to locate and repair.

The new **Detached Elements** panel in Microsoft Edge DevTools helps investigate and resolve a common source of memory leaks.

Memory leaks occur when the JavaScript code of the application retains an increasing number of objects in memory. The JavaScript code should release these objects so that the memory space can be reused by the browser.

For more information, see [Debug DOM memory leaks with the Detached Elements tool](../memory-problems/dom-leaks.md)

*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable v98.
*  This checkbox is not present in Microsoft Edge Canary v100.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## VS Code themes for the DevTools
<!-- preserve literal UI string, including "VS" & "the" -->

*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable v98.
*  This checkbox is not present in Microsoft Edge Canary v100.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Open source files in Visual Studio Code

The **Open source files in Visual Studio Code** experiment replaces the code editor of the Sources tool with Visual Studio Code, for editing local files. When you turn on this experiment, Developer Tools detects when you edit a local file, and prompts you to select a folder to use as your Workspace.

When you select a folder to use as your Workspace, selecting any link to a file in DevTools opens the file in Visual Studio Code.  In previous versions of Microsoft Edge, this action opened the file in the code editor of the Sources tool in DevTools.

![Selecting a file link in the Styles tool opens the file in Visual Studio Code.](../media/experiment-sources-in-code-editor-open.msft.png)

Any edits that you make in DevTools now change the file on the hard drive and sync live with Visual Studio Code. You can read about setting up your workspace in [Opening source files in Visual Studio Code](../sources/opening-sources-in-vscode.md).

*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable v98.
*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Canary v100.


<!-- ====================================================================== -->
## Automatically pretty print in the Microsoft Edge Sources Panel

When this experiment is turned on, when you display a minified file in the Sources panel, the file is opened in a single tab in the Sources panel, pretty-printed.

When this experiment is turned off, a UI prompt with a button asks you whether to pretty-print the file.  The file is opened in an additional tab which has an appended suffix of **:formatted**.

*  A _minified_ file is concatenated into a single long line.
*  In contrast, _pretty print_ presents the contents of a file in an indented, more human-readable format.

*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Stable v98.
*  This checkbox is present in Microsoft Edge Canary v100.

Back-forward cache, or *bfcache*. Makes navigating through your browsing history faster by saving snapshots of visited web pages in memory.

Certain web pages can't be cached. Enable this experiment to add the **Back-forward Cache** section to the **Application** panel.  Enabling back-forward cache debugging provides information about web pages that can't be stored in `bfcache`.

### Enable + button tab menus to open more tools

This experiment started with Microsoft Edge version 89, and is a regular feature as of version 94.

You can now open more tools using the new **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) icon.  After you turn on the **Enable + button tab menus to open more tools** experiment and reload DevTools, a plus sign (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) appears to the right of the tab group at the top of DevTools.  To display a list of other tools that you can add to the tab bar, click the **More Tools** (![The 'More Tools' icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) icon.

### Enable Welcome tab

The Welcome tab was an experiment starting with Microsoft Edge version 89.  It's a regular feature as of version 94.

This experiment replaces the **What's New** tool with the new **Welcome** tool.  It displays a refreshed design for the following content.

*  Links to developer docs
*  Latest features
*  Release notes
*  Option to contact the Microsoft Edge DevTools team

The **Welcome** tool opens automatically after each update to Microsoft Edge.  To prevent the display of the **Welcome** tool after each update, clear the checkbox next to **Open tab after each update** under the **Welcome** tool title.

### Enable new CSS Flexbox debugging features

This was an experiment starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, and is a regular feature as of version 94.

This feature provides many new visualizations to help you debug CSS Flexbox layouts.

#### Displaying persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts with the Inspect tool

The **Inspect** tool provides a quick way to identify and visualize CSS Flexbox layouts in a website by hovering on them with the mouse.  Select the **Inspect** (![Inspect.](../media/inspect-tool-icon-light-theme.png)) icon in the top-left corner of DevTools.  Then, while debugging the website, hover on a flex container to display outlines around the flex container.

#### Displaying persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts

In Microsoft Edge version 89 or later, the CSS Flexbox feature offers the option to turn on persistent overlays on Flexbox layouts.  Persistent overlays provide the following benefits:
*  Persistent overlays remain visible on the webpage as you scroll, move your mouse, and use other features of DevTools.
*  Multiple persistent overlays can be used at the same time, to allow you to review several Flexbox layouts at once.
*  Persistent overlays offer color configuration options.

To toggle persistent overlays on Flexbox layout, do either of the following:
*  Select the **Flexbox** oval icon next to any Flexbox container displayed in the DOM tree of the **Elements** tool.
*  Open the new **Layout** panel located in the **Elements** tool, and select the checkbox next to each Flexbox container you want to highlight.

#### Configuring persistent overlays

To configure options for persistent overlays for CSS grids or Flexbox layouts, use the **Layout** pane.  The **Layout** pane is located in the **Elements** tool next to the **Styles** and **Computed** panes.

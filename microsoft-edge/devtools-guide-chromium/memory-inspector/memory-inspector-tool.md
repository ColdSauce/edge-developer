Use the new **Memory Inspector** tool to inspect an `ArrayBuffer` in JavaScript and Wasm memory.

1. Open the demo webpage [Inspect ArrayBuffers in JS (Memory in JS)](https://memory-inspector.glitch.me/demo-js.html) in a new window or tab.

   The following list of steps is derived from the instructions on that webpage.

1. To open DevTools, right-click the webpage, and then select **Inspect**.  Or, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`I` (macOS).  DevTools opens.

1. In DevTools, on the main toolbar, select the **Sources** tab.  If that tab isn't visible, click the **More tabs** (![More tabs icon.](../media/more-tabs-icon-light-theme.png)) button, or else the **More Tools** (![More Tools icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button.

1. In the **Page** tab on the left, select the file `demo-js.js`. <!-- `memory-write-wasm`-->

1. Set a breakpoint at line 18 in the loop body.

1. Refresh the webpage.

1. In the debugger, in the **Scope** section, expand **Local**.

1. The **Memory Inspector** tool opens in the Drawer.  In the **Memory Inspector** tool, examine the **buffer**.

1. To inspect **Uint8Array b2**, <!-- expand that node to see the buffer, and then select the **Memory** icon (or-->right-click **b2**, and then select **Reveal in Memory Inspector panel**.

1. To inspect **Uint8Array b1**, <!-- expand that node to see the buffer, and then select the **Memory** icon (or-->right-click **b1**, and then select **Reveal in Memory Inspector panel**.  That re-focuses on the **Memory** tab of the first buffer.

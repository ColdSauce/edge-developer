# Source Maps Monitor tool

Use the **Source Maps Monitor** tool to monitor which source files on your webpage requested loading of source maps, and whether the source maps were loaded.  This tool is useful if your webpage uses source maps to [map preprocessed code to source code](../javascript/source-maps.md).


To try this feature:

1. In a new tab or window, follow the instructions in [Map preprocessed code to source code](../javascript/source-maps.md).

1. Close the popup dialog box that the demo opens.

1. In the **Sources** tool, in the **Page** tab, select the file that the demo created for you, such as **Coffee2.js**.

1. In DevTools, on the main toolbar, click the **More Tools** (![More Tools icon.](../media/more-tools-icon-light-theme.png)) button, and then select the **Source Maps Monitor** tool.
